The hot-pink colour scheme gives Wattzo an identity that is sure to stand out and aims to give the brand a ‘non-tech’ feel - this is a lifestyle product for families, not geeks (although we’re sure they’ll love it too!).</p> <p>Wattzo is enabled by a unique power line communications protocol called Wattwave. It is the hope that Wattwave will become an in-built technology in appliances in the future so appliances will come ‘smart home enabled’ and ready to work with Wattzo out of the box.</p> <p>The Wattzo team asked us to create an identity for this technology with the brief that it needed to be able to exist as just a symbol, something that could become as recognisable as the Bluetooth or WiFi icons that are ubiquitous across any device.</p> </div> </div> <div class="row image right" id=mobile> <div class="main mobile"> <img src="/assets/images/mobile.png" alt="Mobile Background" class=bg-image /> <div class=inner-carousel> <img src="/assets/images/wattzo/mobile-app-1.gif" alt="RAU Mobile Website" class=active /> <img src="/assets/images/wattzo/mobile-app-2.gif" alt="RAU Mobile Website"/> <img src="/assets/images/wattzo/mobile-app-3.gif" alt="RAU Mobile Website"/> </div> </div> <div class=text> <h2>Mobile App</h2> <p>The user controls their home via an app that allows them to switch appliances on and off in real time, or set schedules and alerts to suit their lifestyle. For example if you were going on holiday, you could set a schedule for a sequence of appliances (lamps, radio etc.) to come on at key times of the day so as to give the impression the house is still inhabited.</p> <p>This kind of advanced functionality requires a pretty smart interface to keep it simple and intuitive to use. Together with our friends at Calvium, who brought in the technical muscle to build the app, we worked with the Wattzo team to create the app.</p> <p>Working from sketches, wireframes and a prototype we developed the UI for the app, delivering a suite of icons for just about anything you plug in along the way.</p> </div> </div> <div class="row text no-separator" id=future> <div class=text> <h2>The Future</h2> <p>Wattzo is set to hit the market later this year and we’re currently working with Wattzo to develop an e-commerce solution along with tablet and desktop versions of the app.</p> </div> </div> <footer class=site-footer> <h3>Why not pop in? <span>We’ve got biscuits!</span></h3> <div class=col> <p>0117 971 1150</p> <p><a href="mailto:hello@wearebeef.co.uk">hello@wearebeef.co.uk</a></p> <p> <span>Unit 1.10, Paintworks</span> <span>Bristol</span> <span><a href="https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=bs4+3eh&amp;ll=51.444178,-2.567925&amp;spn=0.00983,0.024955&amp;hnear=Arno's+Vale,+BS4+3EH,+United+Kingdom&amp;gl=uk&amp;t=m&amp;z=16" title="Google Map of Beefs Address">BS4 3EH</a></span> </p> </div> <div class=col> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/wearebeef" title="Beef on Twitter">twitter.com/wearebeef</a></p> <p><a href="//www.linkedin.com/company/beef" tittle="Beef on Linkedin">linkedin.com/company/beef</a></p> </div> <p class=copyright> <span>&copy; Copyright 2013</span> <span>Beef Ltd</span> <span>Registered in UK &amp; Wales 5868270</span> <span>Registered for VAT 879682448</span> </p> </footer>
