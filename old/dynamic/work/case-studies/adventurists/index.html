If you fancy driving a mototaxi through a rainforest then these are the guys to talk to. The best part is that it’s all for charity.</p> <p>The Adventurists approached us to help them recruit new adventurers and create a place to see their adventures unfold as they happen.</p> </div> <blockquote class=quote> Beef did a great job of taking our crazy, mixed up existence and making it something special. <p class=author>Mr Tom<span class=role>Founder &amp; Idiot</span></p> </blockquote> <ul class=services> <li class=website><a href="#website"><i></i>Website</a></li> </ul> </div> <div class="row image center" id=website> <div class="main laptop"> <img src="/assets/images/laptop.png" alt="Laptop Background" class=bg-image /> <div class=inner-carousel> <img src="/assets/images/adventurists/website.jpg" alt="Adventurists Website"></img> </div> </div> <div class="text center"> <h2>Website</h2> <div> <p>The Adventurists brand is an idiosyncratic mix of the voice of Reeves &amp; Mortimer with a broken vintage aesthetic - it’s definitely theirs and theirs alone. And, when you spend most of your life in some of the most remote places on the planet organizing the kind of antics that see 1000s of people drive some very unsuitable vehicles from London to Mongolia, one thing you’re sure to have is some pretty special photos.</p> </div> <div class=middle> <p>All of this made designing for The Adventurists a lot of fun, and we developed a rich, textural design framework and put photography right at its heart.</p> <p>One of the challenges of this project lay in structuring the site which needed to be home to 6 adventure microsites as well as having all the registration and customer management built in. When adventures are announced the places often sell out in a matter of hours so the platform needed to be robust and scalable, ready to deal with sudden surges in traffic and requests.</p> </div> <div> <p>The adventure micro-sites make use of full bleed photography to create a more immersive feeling, evocative of that adventure, interspersed with the why and wherefores of how to take part. Elsewhere the site is a mixture of blogs and ramblings about where and what The Adventurists might be up to next - did we mention they’re currently working on a moon landing? Seriously.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="row image right no-separator" id=website> <div class="main tablet"> <img src="/assets/images/tablet-black.png" alt="Laptop Background" class=bg-image /> <div class=inner-carousel> <img src="/assets/images/adventurists/maps.jpg" alt="Adventurists Interactive Maps"></img> </div> </div> <div class=text> <h2>Interactive Maps</h2> <p>When an adventure is live the adventure pages become interactive maps which track the progress of all of the teams taking place and, through the virtue of some pretty hardcore technical jiggery-pokery, teams can send sms, mms, email and video updates all of which are pinned against their journey.</p> <p>The maps aggregate all of this content presenting an almost realtime stream of events as they unfold. Within this each team has its own page, detailing their own journey - how many miles they’ve travelled, how much they’ve raised for their charity, together the updates they’ve sent along the way.</p> <p>When you consider that around 2500 people take part in the Mongol Rally, the behind the scenes tech to make all of this happen is the unseen hero of the project. Generally people don’t take a GPS enabled, or even a ‘modern’ phone, with them so every update goes through some hefty algorithmic mincing to determine its point of origin before it’s placed on the map.</p> </div> </div> <footer class=site-footer> <h3>Why not pop in? <span>We’ve got biscuits!</span></h3> <div class=col> <p>0117 971 1150</p> <p><a href="mailto:hello@wearebeef.co.uk">hello@wearebeef.co.uk</a></p> <p> <span>Unit 1.10, Paintworks</span> <span>Bristol</span> <span><a href="https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=bs4+3eh&amp;ll=51.444178,-2.567925&amp;spn=0.00983,0.024955&amp;hnear=Arno's+Vale,+BS4+3EH,+United+Kingdom&amp;gl=uk&amp;t=m&amp;z=16" title="Google Map of Beefs Address">BS4 3EH</a></span> </p> </div> <div class=col> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/wearebeef" title="Beef on Twitter">twitter.com/wearebeef</a></p> <p><a href="//www.linkedin.com/company/beef" tittle="Beef on Linkedin">linkedin.com/company/beef</a></p> </div> <p class=copyright> <span>&copy; Copyright 2013</span> <span>Beef Ltd</span> <span>Registered in UK &amp; Wales 5868270</span> <span>Registered for VAT 879682448</span> </p> </footer>
