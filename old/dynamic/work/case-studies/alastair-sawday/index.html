Ouch.</p> <p>This template was a single column layout, bloated with extraneous images and resulted in heavyweight emails that recipients did not engage with - often missing promotions and competitions.</p> <p>We introduced a suite of templates for specific tasks with a focus on flexibility, a ‘plug &amp; play’ type solution that allows the C&amp;S team to craft elegant and effective communications without impacting on the brand or design.</p> <p>For technical delivery we looked to the awesome Campaign Monitor, which gives C&amp;S the power to personalise, segment and target their communications and gives them an unprecedented eye on performance; something which the previous solution failed to deliver.</p> <div class="results block"> <h3>Results</h3> <p class="stat open-rates"><span>8.5%</span> Increase in Open Rate</p> <p class="stat click-though"><span>6.5%</span> Increase in Click Throughs (Improved Specificity)</p> <p class="stat admin"><span>75%</span> Reduction in Administration &amp; Management Time</p> </div> </div> </div> <footer class=site-footer> <h3>Why not pop in? <span>We’ve got biscuits!</span></h3> <div class=col> <p>0117 971 1150</p> <p><a href="mailto:hello@wearebeef.co.uk">hello@wearebeef.co.uk</a></p> <p> <span>Unit 1.10, Paintworks</span> <span>Bristol</span> <span><a href="https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=bs4+3eh&amp;ll=51.444178,-2.567925&amp;spn=0.00983,0.024955&amp;hnear=Arno's+Vale,+BS4+3EH,+United+Kingdom&amp;gl=uk&amp;t=m&amp;z=16" title="Google Map of Beefs Address">BS4 3EH</a></span> </p> </div> <div class=col> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/wearebeef" title="Beef on Twitter">twitter.com/wearebeef</a></p> <p><a href="//www.linkedin.com/company/beef" tittle="Beef on Linkedin">linkedin.com/company/beef</a></p> </div> <p class=copyright> <span>&copy; Copyright 2013</span> <span>Beef Ltd</span> <span>Registered in UK &amp; Wales 5868270</span> <span>Registered for VAT 879682448</span> </p> </footer>
