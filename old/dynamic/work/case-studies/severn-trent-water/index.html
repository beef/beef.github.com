In essence, there is a finite amount of investment capital and some things just have to be done. For instance, don’t spend enough cash maintaining the pipe systems and around 1.5m megalitres of water can be lost each year, which adds to your bill and isn’t great for the environment either.</p> </div> <div class=middle> <p>To answer this challenge, we developed the idea of the Water Choice Calculator, an interactive tool that allows Severn Trent customers to help shape the future of their water supply.</p> <p>The Calculator invites the user to choose how much to invest in key areas and see what the consequences, good or bad, would be. Each decision has a financial and environmental cost as well as affecting supply and demand - taking less from rivers is good for the environment but puts strain on the supply, drawing water from deep underground means a plentiful supply but has a high price tag which means higher bills. You get the idea.</p> </div> <div> <p>The overriding factor is to make sure that supply meets demand. Balancing supply to demand can be quite tricky especially if you want to keep bill increases to a minimum and protect the environment.</p> <p>Once a solution that meets supply and demand is reached, customers are invited to submit their choices. What Severn Trent hoped to gain from the campaign was insight into what mattered to their customers and use this information as a basis for future decision making.</p> </div> </div> </div> <footer class=site-footer> <h3>Why not pop in? <span>We’ve got biscuits!</span></h3> <div class=col> <p>0117 971 1150</p> <p><a href="mailto:hello@wearebeef.co.uk">hello@wearebeef.co.uk</a></p> <p> <span>Unit 1.10, Paintworks</span> <span>Bristol</span> <span><a href="https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=bs4+3eh&amp;ll=51.444178,-2.567925&amp;spn=0.00983,0.024955&amp;hnear=Arno's+Vale,+BS4+3EH,+United+Kingdom&amp;gl=uk&amp;t=m&amp;z=16" title="Google Map of Beefs Address">BS4 3EH</a></span> </p> </div> <div class=col> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/wearebeef" title="Beef on Twitter">twitter.com/wearebeef</a></p> <p><a href="//www.linkedin.com/company/beef" tittle="Beef on Linkedin">linkedin.com/company/beef</a></p> </div> <p class=copyright> <span>&copy; Copyright 2013</span> <span>Beef Ltd</span> <span>Registered in UK &amp; Wales 5868270</span> <span>Registered for VAT 879682448</span> </p> </footer>
