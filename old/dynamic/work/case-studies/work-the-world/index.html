From this page the user can quickly change either destination of elective and see the differences.</p> <p>WTW have a very active presence on YouTube so we built-in some nifty integration making easy for WTW to create video galleries across the site, particularly in product pages and case studies, this strategy has shown a marked improvement in user engagement and conversion rates.</p> <p>Work The World have expanded to have a presence across Europe, the US and Australasia so the platform allows them to centrally manage three sites independently or cross-publish to multiple sites.</p> <p>All of this is wrapped up in a bold design that makes Work The World stand head and shoulders above the competition.</p> <p class=live>live site: <a href="//www.worktheworld.co.uk" target=_blank>worktheworld.co.uk</a></p> </div> </div> <div class="row image right no-separator" id=print> <div class=main> <img src="/assets/images/work-the-world/print.gif" alt="Tablet Background" class=single-image /> </div> <div class=text> <h2>Printed Collateral</h2> <p>We’ve helped Work The World present a consistent brand image, developing their brochures, print advertising and stationary.</p> </div> </div> <footer class=site-footer> <h3>Why not pop in? <span>We’ve got biscuits!</span></h3> <div class=col> <p>0117 971 1150</p> <p><a href="mailto:hello@wearebeef.co.uk">hello@wearebeef.co.uk</a></p> <p> <span>Unit 1.10, Paintworks</span> <span>Bristol</span> <span><a href="https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=bs4+3eh&amp;ll=51.444178,-2.567925&amp;spn=0.00983,0.024955&amp;hnear=Arno's+Vale,+BS4+3EH,+United+Kingdom&amp;gl=uk&amp;t=m&amp;z=16" title="Google Map of Beefs Address">BS4 3EH</a></span> </p> </div> <div class=col> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/wearebeef" title="Beef on Twitter">twitter.com/wearebeef</a></p> <p><a href="//www.linkedin.com/company/beef" tittle="Beef on Linkedin">linkedin.com/company/beef</a></p> </div> <p class=copyright> <span>&copy; Copyright 2013</span> <span>Beef Ltd</span> <span>Registered in UK &amp; Wales 5868270</span> <span>Registered for VAT 879682448</span> </p> </footer>
