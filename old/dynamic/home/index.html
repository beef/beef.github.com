But without it you can’t be sure that what you think is needed will work or even if it’s the right thing to do at all.</p> </div> <div class="define home-block"> <i></i> <h3>Define</h3> <p>With the research to guide us, we set about focussing the ideas. Concept designs, wireframing, content planning, prototyping and user-testing can all feature in this phase of work - honing the idea to ensure it hits the mark.</p> <p>What we end up with is a road map to show us the way.</p> </div> <div class="deliver home-block"> <i></i> <h3>Deliver</h3> <p>This is where we don our overalls and get to work.
